To be continued...
Thank you for playing through the whole demo!
I hope you liked it!
There is a lot of stuff planned for this game.
More laser, a green tracting one.
Color mixing puzzle (did you notice that blue and red laser were mixing when crossing?).
More sprites! Gray is boring!
And tons of level and sarcastic dialog of course.
